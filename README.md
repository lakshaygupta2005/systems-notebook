# 🖥️ Operating Systems & Systems Programming Journey

Welcome! This repository documents my structured deep dive into **Operating Systems** and **Systems Programming** during Spring 2025.  
It contains my **notes, projects, and labs** as I follow:

- *Operating System Concepts* (Silberschatz, Galvin, Gagne – the “Dinosaur Book”) 📚  
- MIT’s [6.S081 Operating Systems](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.S081/) & xv6 labs 🛠️  
- Classic texts in systems programming (W. Richard Stevens, Michael Kerrisk) ⚙️

## 🔎 Background  

This repository documents my structured exploration of **Operating Systems and Linux/Unix internals**. It consolidates material from authoritative resources — such as the *Dinosaur Book* and MIT’s xv6 labs — into a single reference point for study and practice.  

The focus is on building a solid theoretical foundation and reinforcing it with **hands-on experiments, kernel-level labs, and notes**.
## 🎯 Purpose of This Repo  

This repository serves as:  
- A **learning journal**, documenting my deep dive into Operating Systems and Systems Programming.  
- A way to **organize and reflect** on what I study each week.  
- A collection of **projects and labs** that put theory into practice (from shells to kernel modifications).  

Along the way, this also becomes a **portfolio of my systems-level work**, demonstrating my ability to learn, build, and document complex software systems.

## 📂 Repository Structure  

- `notes/` → Weekly learning summaries, reflections, and problem breakdowns.  
- `projects/` → Hands-on systems projects:  
  - **Custom Shell** (`myshell.c`)  
  - **Memory Allocator** (custom malloc/free)  
  - **CPU Scheduler Simulation**  
  - **Toy Filesystem (FUSE / in-memory)**  
- `xv6-labs/` → Solutions to MIT xv6 Operating System labs (kernel-level exercises).  

---

## 🚀 Roadmap  

- [x] Week 1 → Build a basic shell (fork + execvp)  
- [ ] Week 2–3 → Add pipes & redirection to shell  
- [ ] Week 4 → Implement custom `malloc` and `free`  
- [ ] Week 6–8 → Synchronization projects (producer-consumer, mutexes)  
- [ ] Week 9–12 → xv6 kernel modifications (system calls, scheduler)  
- [ ] Week 13–16 → Capstone project: Extend xv6 or implement a mini-filesystem

## 📖 Topics I’m Exploring
- Linux fundamentals and shell scripting  
- Process management, memory, and scheduling  
- File systems and storage  
- Networking basics  
- Security and permissions  
- OS concepts through hands-on projects

## 🤝 Contributions
This is primarily a **personal learning repository**. If you notice something that could be improved, feel free to open a discussion or suggest improvements. I’d love to learn from others along the way.
